# OctoPrint-CostEstimation

This OctoPrint plugin displays the estimated print cost for the loaded model. The print cost includes the price for the used filament and the operating cost for the printer.

The cost for the filament is calculated from the price per gramm and the provided length/volume needed for the print.

The operating cost is calculated from the power consumtion of the printer, the price per kWh and the estimated print time of the model.
